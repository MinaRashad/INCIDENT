═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

EXTERNAL EXAMINATION

The body is that of a normally developed, well-nourished 
Asian male appearing consistent with stated age of 41 years.
Length: 71 inches. Weight: 178 pounds.

Rigor mortis: Fully developed in all major muscle groups.
Livor mortis: Fixed, posterior distribution.
Rectal temperature: 86.2°F (scene temperature: 68°F)

Body temperature, scene conditions, and degree of rigor 
suggest post-mortem interval of 8-14 hours at time of 
examination.

CLOTHING

Body clothed in gray cotton t-shirt, black athletic shorts,
and white ankle socks. All items examined and retained as
evidence.

INJURIES

A single perforating gunshot wound of the head:

ENTRANCE: Located on posterior scalp, 2.1 cm superior to
the external occipital protuberance, 0.5 cm right of midline.
Wound measures 0.9 cm in diameter. Marginal abrasion ring
present. Soot deposition and stippling pattern observed in
surrounding tissue.

Assessment: Firearm discharge at intermediate range 
(estimated 6-18 inches).

TRAJECTORY: Projectile track extends anteriorly and slightly
upward through occipital bone, posterior fossa, cerebellum,
midbrain, and frontal lobe.

RECOVERY: One deformed copper-jacketed projectile recovered 
from anterior cranial fossa, submitted to ballistics analysis.
Preliminary assessment consistent with 9mm caliber.

EXIT: None identified.

ADDITIONAL EXTERNAL FINDINGS:

No patterned injuries, ligature marks, or petechiae observed.
Examination of extremities reveals no defensive-type wounds.
No abrasions, contusions, or lacerations of hands or forearms.
Subungual spaces examined - no foreign material observed.

INTERNAL EXAMINATION

HEAD: Extensive intracranial hemorrhage along projectile
track. Basilar skull fracture present. Brain injury pattern
consistent with rapid incapacitation.

CHEST: Thoracic organs grossly unremarkable. No pneumothorax
or hemothorax. Heart weight 380 grams, within normal limits.
Coronary arteries patent without significant atherosclerosis.

ABDOMEN: Liver, spleen, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract
unremarkable. No intra-abdominal hemorrhage or pathology.

TOXICOLOGY

Peripheral blood:
- Ethanol: 0.02 g/dL
- Sertraline detected (0.08 mg/L, therapeutic range)
- No other drugs or volatile substances identified

Urine: Consistent with blood findings.

EVIDENCE COLLECTED

- Projectile (metal jacket, deformed)
- Blood (cardiac and peripheral)
- Urine
- Vitreous humor
- Liver and brain tissue samples
- Fingernail clippings (all digits)
- Scalp tissue surrounding entrance wound
- Clothing items

CAUSE OF DEATH

Gunshot wound of head

MANNER OF DEATH

HOMICIDE

REMARKS

The posterior location of the entrance wound, combined with
the intermediate-range stippling pattern and absence of any
contact-range findings, is not consistent with self-infliction.

The absence of defensive injuries on the hands and forearms
is noted.
